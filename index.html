         <h3>Ashtanga Surya Namaskar</h3>
         <img src="img\Sunsalutation.gif" alt="Basic HathaYoga Poses" height = "200" width = "175">
         <p><b>Sun Salutation</b> (Surya Namaskar - pronounced Sur-yah-Namah-skar​) is a sequence of 12 powerful yoga poses with profound benefits that have been written about for thousands of years.</p>
          <p>At the physical level, the practice of Sun Salutation stimulates the metabolism and the digestive, respiratory, circulatory and reproductive systems. It provides a good cardiovascular workout, stretches every part of the body, lubricates and strengthens joints and muscles. This sequence takes your spine through almost every possible range of motion and when integrated with the breath (the pattern in which we inhale and exhale with each pose), it encourages deep and rhythmic breathing, increasing blood to the brain and bringing mental clarity. </p>

            <h3>Hatha Yoga</h3> 
            <p>Hatha yoga is a strong tool for self-transformation. It asks us to bring our focus to our breath, which helps us to the fluctuations of the mind and is more present in the unfolding of each second. Hatha is also translated as ha meaning &quotsun&quot and tha significance &quotmoon&quot. This refers to the balance of masculine aspects—active, hot, sunlight—and female facets—receptive, cool, moon—within all of us. Hatha yoga is a path toward creating balance and uniting opposites. In our physical bodies, we develop a balance of strength and flexibility. Surrender in each pose and we also learn to balance our attempt. </p>

            <h3>Power Yoga</h3>
            <p>Power yoga is focused on building strength and endurance. It is also an excellent form of yoga for burning calories because power yoga is a fast-paced and intense activity. You move from one posture to another rapidly, linking your breathing to the different motions of your body. When you hold your body in a particular position for more than a few seconds, it fires up your muscles and makes them work hard to keep you in a pose. This can boost your muscle strength and endurance in many parts of your body.</p>

            <h3>Meditation</h3>
            <p>Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state. It's about training in awareness and getting a healthy sense of perspective. You're not trying to turn off your thoughts or feelings.You’re learning to observe them without judgment. And eventually, you may start to better understand them as well. </p>
